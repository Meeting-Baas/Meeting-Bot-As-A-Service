# A simple Desktop app to record a meeting

WIP:

You'll find in this repository, a simple light-weight Desktop App that takes in a meeting link, and sends a bot.

This app is in rust, using tauri, bringing the advantage of creating a desktop app weighing less then 10MB.

To distribute this app to end users, you'll have to sign it, so your users can install it without an OS warning.
