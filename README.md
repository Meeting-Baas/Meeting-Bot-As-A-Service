# Meeting Bass üêü Integration Examples

This repository contains automation examples and code repositories that either:

1. Send Meeting Bots to Google Meet, Zoom and Microsoft Teams in an easy way.

2. Automate data extraction from meetings via LLMs and save on different platforms meeting.

It shows you easy ways to extract data from video meetings and create your own software or automation process.

## Available Setups

Examples are divided in 2: between sending data and handling it.
This is a bit arbitrary as some code examples handle both in one same example both (a) sending and (b) receiving the data.

### Sending Data: Apps & Simple Online Forms

**Tiny Meeting Bot Desktop App with Tauri**

- [View Tauri Desktop App Example](./apps/desktop-rust-app/)

### Handling Data: Software and Automations

**NodeJS App with an online form and meeting data processing**

- [View NodeJS + Rust Example](./apps/rust-send-bots-form/)
  - Using NodeJS and express, create a simple app that:
    -- has a simple sharable page to send a meeting bot.
    -- has an automation process to summarize meeting transcriptions with OpenAI and publish formatted information to a Notion DataBase, with meta-data.
