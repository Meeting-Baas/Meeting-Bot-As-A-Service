# Meeting Baas üêü Integration Examples
![Header](./GithubPreview.png)

Using Meeting's API and open-source examples, this repository contains programs that either:

1. Send Meeting Bots to Google Meet, Zoom and Microsoft Teams in an easy way.

2. Automate :
    - data extraction from meetings and conversations via LLMs
    - to save specific data, and make it easily searchable and indexable.

## Available Setups

Examples are divided in 2:

1. **Stand-alone examples using code** which include:
    - How to send a bot in different fashions (through a calendar API, a Chrome extension, a form, ...)
    - How to handle the data, present it, search inside it, ...

2. **Integrations using third-party software**, whether said software is open-source or not. So of course make.com, n8n.io integrations, but also a Google Calendar form to invite a bot to meeting to record it which you can share with a team, ...

## Apps & Data-Handling

Learn how to invite meeting bots to a meeting for yourself or your users, and view examples to start handling the data quickly.

  - Has an automation process to summarize meeting transcriptions with OpenAI and publish formatted information to a Notion DataBase, with meta-data.
- Technologies used: ExpressJS, Node.
- Third-parties used: OpenAI, Notion.

**[Talking Blob](./apps/rust-talking-blob/)**

## Automations relying on third-party software

Automate data extraction from Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom using third party, "no-code" software.

**[View n8n Example](./to-other-apps/meeting-to-notion-with-n8n/)**
- Automate meeting transcription and Notion sync using n8n's visual workflow editor and the AI Meeting Bot API.

**[View Make Example](./to-other-apps/meeting-to-airtable-with-make/)**
